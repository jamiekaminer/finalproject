	<p>Orion the Hunter appears in the winter sky, with his bow and his hunting dogs, Canis Major and Canis Minor, behind him. Greek Mythology tells us Orion was a talented hunter. He claimed he could rid the earth of wild animals and upset the Earth Goddess. She sent a scorpio to kill him. The scorpio one and Artemis found his body in the sea. She begged the gods to bring her friend Orion back to life, but they refused. Instead, she put Orion's picture in the sky so that she could always see him.</p>
