Final Project Outline

For my final project I am inspired by space. I have always been fascinated by space and the mysteries that it involves. I want the project to be an artistic and abstract representation of different elements of space. I do not want anything to be too literal but I would like the theme to be clear. I was inspired to create my project about space because of the recent photo captured of the black hole and I am going to create one of my full-browser drawings inspired by that photo and the concept of a black hole. I would like to add animation so that it looks like the user is diving in to the black hole.

Another one of my favorite concepts of space is the planets orbiting around the sun. For another one of my drawings I am going to use CSS animation to create an abstract orbit of planets. 

Finally, I am also very interested in astrology and for my third drawing I would like to create a full page drawing using SVG constellations. I am thinking that I would like if when the user clicks on a constellation the page zooms in and a caption appears with the story of the constellation.
